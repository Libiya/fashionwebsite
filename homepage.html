<p>Explorers and exploring feeds our insatiable desire to know more, to see more and to experience life fully. It feeds our dreams. It fuels our creativity. It is, what all children aspire to, and what the child within us secretly longs for when the mundane overwhelms us. So it emerges in films and books, poetry and faded images from the past to encourage us to be explorers again, even if just for a day, week or month.</p>
